There are no previous radiographs available for comparison. \n\n\n\nAirway findings: A smoothly marginated soft tissue opacity is variably present overlying the dorsal aspect of the trachea at the thoracic inlet. This opacity reduces approximately 50% of the dorsoventral diameter of the trachea. The intrathoracic trachea is normal. Within the lung parenchyma there is a mixed bronchointerstitial opacification, predominantly caudal dorsally. The mainstem bronchi taper poorly. There is mild focal interstitial opacification in the left cranial lung lobe adjacent to the rib sections, however some obliquity is present. No associated osteolysis of the ribs is seen.\n\n\n\nCardiovascular findings: The cardiac silhouette is normal in shape, size and margination. The cranial and caudal pulmonary vasculature is normal. The caudal vena cava is normal. The aorta and mainstem pulmonary artery have a normal outline in the vd/dv l image.\n\n\n\nMediastinum and pleural space: There is some ventral pleural fat accumulation.\n\n\n\nMusculoskeletal findings: No significant abnormalities are detected.\n\n\n\nIncluded abdomen: No significant abnormalities are detected.",
